# CSS-Animation

A simple project that demonstrates CSS animations and interactive UI components using pure HTML and CSS.

## Overview

This project showcases how to build interactive web elements with animated effects using just CSS and HTML. The main feature is an animated `<div>` whose behavior can be toggled by a custom "move button" switch. The project is modularized with separate CSS files for layout, animation, and the button component.

## Features

- **Animated Div:** A visual element (`#animated-div`) with CSS-driven animation.
- **Move Button:** An interactive checkbox switch that triggers the animation.
- **Component-based CSS:** The CSS is organized into modular components for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ page-layout.css
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ animated-div.css
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ move-button.css
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
```

- `index.html`: Main HTML file, includes the structure and references to the styles.
- `styles.css`: Imports component styles.
- `styles/components/`: Contains modular CSS files for layout, animation, and the button.
